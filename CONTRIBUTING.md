# Instructions for Logging Issues

## 1. Do you have a suggestion?

We also accept suggestions in the issue tracker.

In general, things we find useful when reviewing suggestions are:
* A description of the problem you're trying to solve
* An overview of the suggested solution
* Examples of how the suggestion would work in various places
  * Code examples showing e.g. "this would be an error, this wouldn't"
  * Code examples showing the generated JavaScript (if applicable)
* If relevant, precedent in other languages can be useful for establishing context and expected behavior


# Instructions for Contributing Code

## Housekeeping

Your pull request should: 

* Include a description of what your change intends to do
* Have clear commit messages 
* To avoid line ending issues, set `autocrlf = input` and `whitespace = cr-at-eol` in your git configuration
 -- `git config --global core.autocrlf input`
 -- `git config --global core.whitespace cr-at-eol`
